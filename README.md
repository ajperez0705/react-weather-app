# Weather App

## Summary
The transition from using pure HTML, CSS, and JS, to JSX and React was a little difficult in the beginning due to syntax and and the way data was passed between components; however, this project really solidified my React fundamentals. Although admittedly simple and common for a project, I include it show my improvement as a developer and how I used it as a stepping stone for bigger things to come!  In addition, I chose to slightly differentiate it from the pack by implementing a dynamic weather background that changes based on the current temperature of either the users current location, or the chosen destination.

### Functionality
1. On load, shows the user the weather of the user's current location using the Geolocator Navigation API.
2. User can search for a city throughout the world and view the current weather there.
3. User can save the location within a list.
4. While the save list is open, the user can render the saved location, or remove it from the list.

### What I Learned
1. 1. Solidified React fundamentals (useState, useEffect) and Architecture. 
2. How async functionality works with useEffect, and how API calls work in React. 
3. JSX syntax and conditional logic

### Built Using
1. React
2. CSS / SASS
3. Geolocation Navigator and Sky Scanner APIs

## Design Work and Inspiration
Before touching code, I like to make use of a moodboard and design program like Adobe XD to plan my attack.

Here is the main source of inspiration for this app: <img src="/readme/images/react-weather-app-inspiration.png" width="200">
